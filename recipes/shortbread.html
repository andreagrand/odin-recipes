         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>A very long time ago, biscuits were made from leftover baked goods which 
            were repurposed into another form. You may remember I explained that “biscotti”
             means “cooked twice” in Italian, which is where the word, “biscuit” comes
              from. When butter began being added, these biscuits were no longer cooked
               twice, but the name remained.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 sticks salted butter</li>
            <li>extra sugar to sprinkle on top</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together by hand or mixer, to a stiff consistency 
                (the butter shouldn't be too soft, but also not straight from the fridge, 
                especially if you use a mixer). Don't overwork the dough; stop when it just
                 comes together</li>
            <li>Roll out into the shape of a pan or tin you want to bake them in. I baked this
                 in an 8 x 8 pan. Trim the edges to the approximate size. </li>
            <li>FINGERS: Place it in the pan of your choice. One mistake many people make 
                is rolling the shortbread too thin. Proper shortbread should be quite thick
                 (no less than 3/4" or 2cm if making fingers). Next, prick the shortbread with 
                a fork, about halfway through.</li>
            <li>ROUND: You can also shape the dough into a ball, roll it out into a round, and
                 score into triangles, then prick with a fork. </li>
            <li>MOULD: (brush the mold with a little oil, and sugar first to ensure it comes out nicely).
                 Roll out the dough, place over the mould and roll again to press into it. Remove the 
                 excess dough then turn out onto a tray.
                If your shortbread mould doesn't have a pretty design, prick it with a fork</li>
            <li>Place in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until slightly brown on edges.
                 Sprinkle with sugar immediately upon removing from the oven. Shortbread shouldn't 
                 be darkly colored. 
                Let your shortbread cool on or in the pan or tray before moving to rack to cool 
                completely.</li>
        </ol>
