        <h3>Descripion</h3>
        <p>Whenever I think of Christmas cookies, gingerbread cookies come to mind first.
             Well, after Christmas sugar cookies of course! Their spice, their molasses
              flavor, their SMILES, and their charm are obviously irresistible.
             Gingerbread cookies, you have my heart</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp allspice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li>
            <li>10 tbsp unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup dark molasses</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, 
                baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, 
                and cloves. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer
                     fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 
                     1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and 
                     creamy. Add the brown sugar and molasses and beat on medium
                      high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides 
                      and bottom of the bowl as needed. Next, beat in egg and
                       vanilla on high speed for 2 full minutes. Scrape down
                        the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. The butter
                         may separate; that’s ok.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, and beat on low speed 
                until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick and slightly sticky. 
                Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap.
                 Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. Chill discs
                  for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.
                 Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough. I always chill 
                 mine overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets 
                with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
                 (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator.
                 Generously flour a work surface, as well as your hands and 
                 the rolling pin. Roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Tips for 
                 rolling– the dough may crack and be crumbly as you roll. What’s
                  helpful is picking it up and rotating it as you go. Additionally, 
                  you can use your fingers to help meld the cracking edges back together. 
                  The first few rolls are always the hardest since the dough is so stiff,
                   but re-rolling the scraps is much easier. Cut into shapes.
                    Place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Re-roll
                     dough scraps until all the dough is shaped.
                 Repeat with remaining disc of dough.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are 
                smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes. If your cookie 
                cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes. My 
                oven has hot spots and yours may too- so be sure to rotate the
                 pan once during bake time. Keep in mind that the longer the cookies 
                 bake, the harder and crunchier they’ll be. For soft gingerbread cookies, 
                follow my suggested bake times.</li>
            <li>Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer
                 to cooling rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, decorate as desired.</li>
            <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week</li>
